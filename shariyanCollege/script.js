// Topic: JacaScript versions

// There are two main versions of javaScript that are used in day to day js programming
// 1. javascript ES5, releaed in 2009
// 2. javascript ES6, released in 2015

// normally in computer languages we use only one version which is most likely the latest version but in 
// case of js we use both the versions at a time

// there are some differences in both the versions like one of the main is, the jsES5 consist of only one varible data
// type which was var, then in jsES6 let and const was introduced, at present if we use var keyword it means we are
// using jsES5 and if in the same program we use let or const it means we are using both the version in the program
