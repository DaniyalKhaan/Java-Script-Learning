// Topic: Smooth Scrolling
// to apply smooth scrolling these are the steps;

//1. Search of "locomotive js github" and open the locomotive github repo/link

// 2. scroll down and you will see css section in which there will be a link to css repo open that link and copy the css code
// with out comments, paste this code in a new css file and link this file with the html file

//3. now scroll below and you will see a section named "smooth", copy js code from there ( a small funcion it is)
 // and paste it inside script.js file( this time you dont have to make a new file liks css),
 // change the name of the element you want to apply smoth scrolling on(in most cases it will be div containg all 
 //page such as main -etc)

 // 4. now search for locomotive js cdn , open the first cdn website, there will be some option, open min js one of them
 // and copy the link(yes address), in you html file write a script tag paste this link as "src".


 // 5. Make sure all the files are link to the html file and is finished, smoth scrolling is applied to your document

 // Note: when the smoth scrolling is applied to a document it may cause/make some thin lines/border at places
 // where two div tags are intercecting. To solve this problem make the background color of the main page to black
 // by this those lines will be dissapear.
