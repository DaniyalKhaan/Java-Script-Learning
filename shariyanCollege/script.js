// Topic: Heap Memory

// heap memeory can also be called temporary memory in order to perfom some
// operation we need to store some values somewhere in our computer which at
// the point of time not are final result/answer. see the examplt below 
// to understand this concept clearly

// Example:

// Imagine you have to add multiple numbers and print the sum of all the numbers
// now, what computer does it takes one value add it with another value, then
// store sum of both the values somewhere (heap memory) then computer add third value 
// to the sum and so on, In this example the memory which computer needs
// to store the temprarory result/calculation is called heap memory


let num1 = 1;
let num2 = 2;
let num3 = 3;
let num4 = 4;
let num5 = 5;

let sum = num1 + num2 + num3 + num4 + num5
// computer will need to add the upper variable one by one and store
// result in heap memory until the final result is not acheived
