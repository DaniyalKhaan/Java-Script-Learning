// Topic : ... (spread operator)
// spread operator (...) makes things very easy when we are dealing with Arrays and
// String basically it can spread the complete String and Arrays complete elements

// Syntax:

let iAmArray = ["a","f","h","s","w","r","b","m"];

// console.log(iAmArray);
// see when I am printin this array it display output as Array(8) {means an Array of 8 elements}
// but what if we want to display all the elements, we can use spread operator 

// EXAMPLE:


console.log(...iAmArray);
// this time it is showing all the elements of array in output 

//  we can also use ... method if we want to assign an array to another element
